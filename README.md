## Collecting touch type data

Using [gaia keyboard](https://github.com/timdream/gaia-keyboard-demo) to collect touch data

### How to install
The app can be found at http://brianweet.azurewebsites.net  
Please install as a hosted app on a Keon/dolphin using the app-manager or webIDE.

### What is it?
The app shows you a keyboard and a sentence that you have to type.
All touch events are logged and saved sent to a server, this way we will be able to re-execute your typing efforts!
You can take your time reading the sentence, once you start typing the timer starts and the timer bar starts decreasing.  
But no pressure, just type like you would do in a normal situation. The only difference is you won't be able to correct any mistakes ;)

### Time's up!
Or you are super awesome and there are no sentences left!
Please submit your 'score' to the server.
If you run the app more than once, please use **the same nickname**.
This will allow me to create user specific models based on more than one 'typing session'.

### Sentence dataset
The app uses a part of the memorable dataset described here: [Enron mobile dataset](http://keithv.com/pub/enronmobile/mobile_email_dataset.pdf)
